# C++17 for Pythonists

**UNDER WORK**

## Description

First contact with C++, in its most used version in new physics projects : aka C++17.
The course is targeted at people who have a minimal programming experience, especially with Python.

In particular, we will talk about :
- builtin types, variables, functions,
- passing arguments by value and by reference,
- type inference and templates,
- returning a tuple of values,
- std::vector, the ultimate collection,
- loops and algorithms (foreach, transform),
- lambdas functions.

## Storyboard

1. files : preprocess, compile, main, link, run.
2. variables : semantic, garbage collector, duck typing.
3. functions : name, local and global variables.

4. files : static and shared libraries.
5. collections : ==, shallow and deep copy, why it is slow, why numpy is fast.
6. functions : first-class citizen, decorators.

## Internals

This course is prepared using the tools and the `Cpp20` image from [DevScripts](https://github.com/chavid/DevScripts).
