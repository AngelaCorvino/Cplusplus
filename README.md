# C++17 for Pythonists

We propose here a first contact with C++, in its most used version in new physics projects : aka C++17. The course is targeted at people who have a minimal programming experience, especially with Python (beware: this is not a course about connecting Python code with C++ code).

**1. Basic data process bricks**

- [Variables, builtin type, type inference](ClassRoom/01-variables-and-types.ipynb).
- [Arrays vs vectors](ClassRoom/02-arrays-vs-vectors.ipynb).
- [Functions, references and const](ClassRoom/03-functions-and-references.ipynb), (functions : name, local and global variables, passing arguments by value, by reference, by const reference, returning a tuple of values to a nienniennien) algorithms (foreach, transform)))

**2. Still the legacy compilation process**

- [Compilation steps](ClassRoom/04-compilation.ipynb).
- [Units and libraries](ClassRoom/05-units.ipynb).
- [Build tools](ClassRoom/06-make.ipynb).

**3. Homework**

Take the Python code in the `Homework` directory, and translate it to C++. You should try to keep the split in several files, and use `make` or `cmake` so to build the final executable.

**Subjective final word**

We have barely scratched the surface of the subject. C++ is a very rich and complex language, which is worth the investment if you look for the ultimate perfomance, and do not care too much about fast compilation and clear error messages... There is more to come with C++20 and soon C++23, that may review deeply the compilation process with the new C++ *modules* , improve readibility and gain even more performance with *concepts*, *ranges*, and *coroutines*.
